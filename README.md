# baseutils
###### Implementations of basic Unix utilities

## About
`baseutils` is all about no-nonsense, lean & clean implementations of basic
Unix utilities -- while also shooting for POSIX compliance.

## Status
baseutils is currently in an extremely early stage of development. However, its
got a few utilities and is far enough to have some personality/convention. 
Because of this I'm putting out an initial "release" -- its notional more than
anything -- to establish some convention and get some eyes and feedback.
Let me know how you think it looks.

## Utilities

Utilities implemented so far:

* [cat](cat.c)
* [pwd](pwd.c)
* [head](head.c)
* [mkdir](mkdir.c)
* [rmdir](rmdir.c)
* [chmod](chmod.c)
* [basename](basename.c)
* [dirname](dirname.c)
* [echo](echo.c)
